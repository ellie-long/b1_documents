This leading twist tensor structure function quantifies effects not present in 
the case of spin-half hadrons. However the only available targets to study the 
tensor polarization effects on the nucleon substructure are nuclei. From what 
we learn in the previous section, a measurement of $b_1$ would allow us to take 
a deeper look at the nucleus internal dynamics as $b_1$ should be zero if the 
nucleus is made up of spin-half constistuents at rest, or in a relative $s$-wave. 
Therefore a non-negligible value of $b_1$ can be translated into the deviation 
of a nucleus from a simple bound state of protons and neutrons.

\subsubsection{Contribution to $b_1$ from conventional nuclear effects}
The deuteron is the simplest spin-1 many-body nuclear system. In Ref.~\cite{Hoodbhoy:1988am},
the authors evaluate the value of $b_1$ under three assumptions on the deuteron
constituents and their dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The deuteron is composed of two spin-1/2 non-interacting nucleons at rest. 
In this case, the eight helicity amplitudes characteristic of a spin-1 target are 
expressed in terms of the four helicity amplitudes of each spin-1/2 nucleons and 
therefore they can also be reduced from eight to four independent. All structure 
functions of the deuteron are the simple sum of the structure functions of the two 
nucleons except for the tensor structure functions which should vanish: $b_1 = b_2 
= b_3 = b_4 = 0$. 
 \item The deuteron is composed of two spin-1/2 nucleons moving non-relativistically 
in a central potential. The target motion modifies the helicity amplitudes. Using
the convolution formalism, it was found that the contribution of these moving nucleons
to $b_1$ is small and is dominated by the lower component of the nucleon's Dirac
wave function.
 \item The deuteron contains a $D$-state admixture. Because the proton and the neutron
are moving in opposite direction, an additional term due to the $s-d$ interference 
appears in the convolution procedure. This extra contribution to $b_1$ is predicted
to be even smaller than in the previous case.
\end{itemize}

However, at the quark level, when considering the case of massless relativistic quark, 
$b_1$ exhibits very large negative values peaked at $x=0.5$~\cite{Hoodbhoy:1988am}.
In this calculation, a meson in $j=1$ state is formed from the coupling of a $P_{3/2}$ 
massless quark with a spin-1/2 spectator.

In 1988, Miller also examined the tensor structure function $b_1$~\cite{Miller:1989nc}.
The basic mechanism is that the virtual photon hits an exchanged pion (OPEP). The OPEP 
is responsible for the binding of the deuteron. The calculation depends on the pion 
structure function which carries uncertainty. 
In this early caculation, the convention used by Miller was different from the
one used in the HERMES results and in Ref.~\cite{Kumano:2010vz}. The updated calulation
calculation~\cite{Miller_tmp} is shown in Fig.~\ref{xb1_pred}. Also the pion structure 
function from~\cite{Sutton:1991ay} was used. The spread of the curve originates from the 
parameter $A_s=(.9 \pm 0.3)$ governing the strength of the sea in the pion. These 
numbers are all in qualitative agreement with HERMES, given their large error bars.
Another mechanism is expecting to contribute: coherent-double scattering. Miller 
specified that his mechanism is not the same as that, even though the HERMES 
publication~\cite{Airapetian:2005cb} combined them together.

%neutrons.
%
Using Vector Meson Dominance (VMD), the authors~\cite{Bora:1997pi} isolate the 
double-scattering contribution to $b_1$. The existence length of a vector meson can 
be described by the coherence length $\lambda$: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda = \frac{Q^2}{M x (M_v^2 + Q^2)}
\end{eqnarray}
which is the length over which the vector meson propagates during the time $\Delta t 
= 1/\Delta E$. Therefore, for multiple scattering to occur, a minimum coherence length 
of $\approx$ 1.7 fm (the internucleon separation in the nucleus) is required. At 
$x > 0.3$, the coherence length is only about the size of the nucleon so multiple 
scattering contribution is anticipated to be negligible. However, for $x \le 0.1$, 
double-scattering should be significant in $b_1$ behaving as $(1-x)^{2\delta}/x^{1+2\delta}$, 
where $\delta$ is determined from the soft pomeron intercept $\alpha_P(t=0) = 1 + \delta$.
Finally the auhors forsee an significant enhancement of $b_1$ at low $x$ ($\le$ 0.01) 
due to the quadrupole deformation of the deuteron.

\subsection{Comments from theorists}

We have contacted many of the theorists who have made calculations on the tensor structure functions.
We have received extremely high support from them and they are all encouraging strongly more 
precise measurement.

``{\it The tensor structure of the deuteron can be investigated in the deep
inelastic region by measuring the structure function $b_1$, which
should shed light on a new aspect of tensor-structure studies in
terms of quark degrees of freedom instead of hadronic ones.
There is a conventional approach for theoretically calculating $b_1$
by quark distribution functions convoluted with nucleon momentum
distributions in the deuteron including the $D$-state admixture.
According to our experience on the nucleon-spin issue, such
a conventional approach for high-energy spin physics would not work.
In particular, it is known that $b_1$ is sensitive to dynamical aspects
of constituents with angular momenta. Measurements of $b_1$ could open
a new field of spin physics because this kind of spin physics has not
been explored anywhere else. Only experimental information came from
the HERMES collaboration; however, their data are not accurate enough
to find $x$ dependence of $b_1$ especially at large $x$. It is
an unique opportunity at JLab to develop this new field of spin physics.}''

``{\it I'm glad to hear that $b_1$ is not forgotten in all the excitement about other spin dependent 
effects. I don't have much to add to the existing discussion of $b_1$ in the literature. If I 
remember correctly, the hard thing is to distinguish a non-trivial contribution to $b_1$ (eg. 
from 6 quark correlations in the deuteron) from the contribution from the deuteron d-wave. I 
also remember a debate about a double scattering contribution.  I wrote a paper on that subject 
with an Indian visitor to the CTP.  I believe our work was a follow-on to work by Nikolaev and 
Schafer~\cite{Nikolaev:1996jy}.  I think these papers suggested large contributions to $b_1$ at 
low x and low $Q^2$.}''

``{\it I am particularly interested in signatures of novel QCD effects in the deuteron. The tensor 
charge could be sensitive to hidden color (non-nucleonic) degrees of freedom at large $x$. It is
also interesting that antishadowing in DIS in nuclei is not universal but depends on the quark 
flavor and spin. One can use counting rules from PQCD to predict the $x \to 1$ dependence of the 
tensor structure function.}''
