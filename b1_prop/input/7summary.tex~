This experiment will require 28 days of beam time in order to perform a 
precision measurement of $b_1^d$ using a longitudinally polarized deuteron 
(LiD) target, together with the Hall C HMS and SHMS standard equipment for
electron detection.



%We request xx days in order to perform a precision measurement of $b_1^d$
%using a longitudinally 
%polarized proton (NH$_3$) target, together with the Hall X xxx detector.
%This experiment is fascinating and all PAC members should be fascinated by it.
