We request \total_days days of beam time in order to perform a 
precision measurement of $b_1^d$ using a longitudinally polarized deuteron 
(\TARGET) target, together with the Hall C HMS and SHMS spectrometers.
All existing theoretical predictions for $b_1$ in the region of interest predict small or vanishing
values for $b_1$  at intermediate values of $x$, in contrast to the apparent large negative result of the only existing measurement from HERMES. Tensor structure measurements provide information not available from spin-1/2 targets. This measurement will help clarify the role quark orbital angular momentum plays in the nucleon spin, and open a new avenue of spin structure studies at Jefferson Lab.
